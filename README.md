## Libraries used

* ReactJS
* Chakra UI
* Framer Motion

## History
This is a React Application that was built using Typescript. You've just been added to the team, and noticed there are NO TESTS! Someone was nice enough to add in a Playwright config and example, but it doesn't meet most of our needs. You'll be assigned tasks to complete to start getting automation in place.

##
Getting Started

`npm i` to install all node modules

## Helpful Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the webserver, and executes the existing Playwright Tests.

### Track your session stats

Check out how productive you are in each session with the help of the StatCard components.
